# Pokemon Store

:rocket: A demo of this project is available [here]().

***Pokemon Store***  is a project that has the following features:

* The store is organized according to the type of Pok√©mon. There are [18-type Pok√©mon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type), but the store only has two types: [Fire](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Fire_(type)) and [Water](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Water_(type)).

* In the **Fire Tab**, you can see the complete list of fire-type Pokemon. And in the **Water Tab**, you can see the full list of water-type Pokemon.
  * Each items in the list presented:
    * Image,
    * Name,
    * Weight [Kg],
    * Price based on its *base_experience*, and
    * Button for add to cart (Catch it!).
* In the **Cart Tab**, you can see the number of the purchased items and the detailed summary. 
  * Each purchased item presented:
    * Image,
    * Name,
    * Price = Price * quantity,
    * Quantity, and
    * Option to add or remove items.
  * Total Weight (Sum of total weight),
  * Subtotal (Sum of the total price of the items),
  * Shipping (Weight percent = Weight / 10),
  * Total (Subtotal + Shipping), and
  * Finish shopping (Catch 'em all!).


## Technologies

* The project was developed using the framework [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).
* CSS was used for the basic styling of the navbar, forms, and other components.
* [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/) was used for complementary styling, and to have a better user experience, [react-infinite-scroller](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroller) was used to load content.
* The RESTful Pokemon API [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) was used to request the Pok√©mon.
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) was used to promise-based HTTP client.
* Finally, [Heroku](www.heroku.com) was used to deploy the project.

## About the Challenge

Develop a store using the ReactJS framework.

### Briefing

We want at least two stores for two types of Pok√©mon (water, fire, dragon, etc.) with different styles, maintaining the same behavior.

### Goals

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) consists of:

* [x] Product catalog.
* [x] Side cart.
* [x] Cart summary.
* [x] 2 stores with different styles and types of Pok√©mon.

Bonus features:

* [ ] Search bar to filter Pok√©mon.
* [ ] Checkout button, restarting the purchase process.
* [ ] Modal thanks to checkout.
* [ ] Save user purchase data locally so as not to lose it when refreshing the page.
