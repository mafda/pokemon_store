:rocket: A demo of ***Pokemon Store*** is available [**here**](https://mafda-pokemon-store.herokuapp.com/).


## Overview

***PokÃ©mon Store*** is a shopping cart project to purchase wild PokÃ©mon. It was developed using the ReactJS framework.

The store is presented according to the type of PokÃ©mon. There are [18-type PokÃ©mon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type), but the store only has two types: [Fire](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Fire_(type)) and [Water](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Water_(type)).

This project is organized into the following **components**:

* Cart
  * In this component, the detailed summary of the purchased items was presented. 
    * Each purchased item presents:
      * Image,
      * Name,
      * Price = Price x Quantity,
      * Quantity, and
      * Controls to add or remove items.
    * Total Weight (Sum of total weight),
    * Subtotal (Sum of the total price of the items),
    * Shipping ($0.1 per kilogram),
    * Total (Subtotal + Shipping), and
    * Finish shopping (Catch 'em all!).
* Footer
  * In this component, you can see developer info.
* Header
  * In this component, the navigation bar has two buttons to change between the types of PokÃ©mon:
    * In the **Fire Button**, you can see the complete list of fire-type PokÃ©mon. 
    * In the **Water Button**, you can see the full list of water-type PokÃ©mon.
  * Also, the number of items purchased appears on the right side.
    * The **Cart Button** allows to show or hide the detailed summary of the purchased items.
* Modal
  * In this component, the modal thanks to checkout and restarting the purchase process.
* ProductsGrid
  * This component presents the list of the available PokÃ©mon.
  * Each PokÃ©mon card has the following features:
    * Image,
    * Name,
    * Weight [kg],
    * Price based on its `base_experience`, and
    * Button for add to cart (Catch it!).
* Styling
  * This component is used to define the color palette of each store in a dynamic way. It does not alter the application behavior.

## Technologies

* The project was developed using the framework [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).
* CSS was used for the basic styling of the navbar, forms, and other components.
* [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/) was used for complementary styling.
* [react-modal](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal) was used in the checkout button, and restarting the purchase process.
* In order to have a better user experience, [react-infinite-scroller](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroller) was used to load content.
* The RESTful PokÃ©mon API [PokÃ©API](https://pokeapi.co/) was used to request the PokÃ©mon.
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) was used as HTTP client.
* Finally, [Heroku](www.heroku.com) was used to deploy the project.
