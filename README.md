## Overview

***Pokemon Store*** is a project with two stores for two types of PokÃ©mon using the ReacJS framework.

The store is presented according to the type of PokÃ©mon. There are [18-type PokÃ©mon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type), but the store only has two types: [Fire](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Fire_(type)) and [Water](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Water_(type)).

This project is organized into the following **components**:

* Cart
  * In this component, the detailed summary of the purchased items was presented. 
    * Each purchased item presented:
      * Image,
      * Name,
      * Price = Price x Quantity,
      * Quantity, and
      * Option to add or remove items.
    * Total Weight (Sum of total weight),
    * Subtotal (Sum of the total price of the items),
    * Shipping ($0.1 per kilogram),
    * Total (Subtotal + Shipping), and
    * Finish shopping (Catch 'em all!).
* Footer
  * In this component, you can see developer info.
* Header
  * In this component, the navigation bar on the left was defined to change between the types of PokÃ©mon:
    * In the **Fire Button**, you can see the complete list of fire-type Pokemon. 
    * In the **Water Button**, you can see the full list of water-type Pokemon.
  * Also, the number of items purchased was defined on the right.
    * In the **Cart Button**, you can show or hide the detailed summary of the purchased items.
* ProductsGrid
  * In this component, each item of the list of PokÃ©mon was presented.
  * Each item has the following features:
    * Image,
    * Name,
    * Weight [kg],
    * Price based on its *base_experience*, and
    * Button for add to cart (Catch it!).
* Styling
  * In this component, the color palette was defined for each store, maintaining the same behavior. 



## Technologies

* The project was developed using the framework [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).
* CSS was used for the basic styling of the navbar, forms, and other components.
* [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/) was used for complementary styling, and to have a better user experience, [react-infinite-scroller](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroller) was used to load content.
* The RESTful Pokemon API [PokÃ©API](https://pokeapi.co/) was used to request the PokÃ©mon.
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) was used to promise-based HTTP client.
* Finally, [Heroku](www.heroku.com) was used to deploy the project.
